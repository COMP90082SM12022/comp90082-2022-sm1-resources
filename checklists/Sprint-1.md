## Background description, client goals, motivation

## Analysis of requirements (User Stories or Use Cases)

- [x] The analysis of requirements was performed on most of the existing requirements. 
- [x] The [new set of] requirements is consistent to the scope of the project, completely cover the new capabilities required by the client and are well documented/structured/organized on Confluence.
- [x] The requirements can be documented in the form of user stories or use cases, supplementary specification of design/implementation/deployment requirements, prototypes, and others. It may also be necessary to be explicit about what is not in scope to define the scope boundary more clearly.

## Development environment

- [x] Trello (or Github projects or JIRA) is created, structured and organized. 
- [x] README file is updated and provide details about the project, workflow (branches/naming conventions and so on).

- [x] Requirements were estimated and prioritized.

## Meetings

- [x] Meetings are recorded in Confluence and only. They were NOT exported to Github as they're part of internal process.
